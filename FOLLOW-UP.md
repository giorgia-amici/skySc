# General:

### Q) How long did you spend on the test?
I spent 2 days

### Q) If you had more time, what further improvements or new features would you add?
I would have added some pagination to decrease the time in which the application is ready to be used.

### Q) Which parts are you most proud of? And why?
I am really proud of the modularity of the React part of this test as React is still fairly new to me.
### Q) Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
Discovering all the fields I needed from the API as I needed them while developing the frontend
### Q) How did you find the test overall? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test or our API, we'd love to hear them.
It was a lot of fun to work with the Skyscanner API and making something that is a real product for you based on live data.
